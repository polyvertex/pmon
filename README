PMon
A small monitoring system for Linux written in Perl.

The client script (agent), installed on every machines to monitor, is
periodically launched as a cron job to send some statistics to the remote
service about the cpu, memory, storage, etc...
These statistics are then stored by the service (a daemon) in a SQL database
(any backend will do) and used to build graphics that can be published through a
dynamically created website.

Tested on Debian only.
The client script is highly inspired from OVH's RTM client script (ovh.com).
