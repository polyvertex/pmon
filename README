PMon

A small monitoring system for Linux (tested on Debian only) based on a
service/node architecture. The client script (node), which is highly inspired
from OVH's RTM client script (ovh.com), sends periodically informations about
the monitored machines to the server. Every informations sent by the nodes are
stored in a SQL database by a daemon on the server and graphics can be generated
through the use of RRDTool intermediate databases.
